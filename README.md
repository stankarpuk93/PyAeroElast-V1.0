# PyAeroElast-V 1.0
PyAeroElast is a low-fidelity Aeroelastic estimation tool for conceptual aircraft design and rapid analysis of static and dynamic aeroelasticity of high aspect-ratio metallic wings.

Methods used in the code are based on methodologies described in  R. Bisplinghoff, H. Ashley, R. Halfman 'Aeroelasticity'

Capabilities of PyAeroElast:
- Aerodynamic analysis of rigid straignt tapered wings using semi-empirical and Vortex Lattice methods
- Aeroelastic divergence analysis
- Control reversal analysis
- Modified lift distribution analysis including the wing flexibility
- Flutter anallysis using Theodorsen's aerodynamic definition for unsteady aerodynamics
